        We are 8 University College London (UCL) third year Physics undergraduates undertaking a PHAS0052 Physics Group
        Project module.
        In this 9-week-long project, we have worked as a team to research different applications of origami, test
        several shrinking materials for their folding capability and present our results in a form of a report, a
        presentation and a website you are currently on.
        This module let us all develop both as members of a team and individually.
