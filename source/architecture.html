      <p class="paragraph">
        In the field of architecture, a few parameters are taken into consideration in order for
        a structure to be considered well designed and this can depend on the purpose of
        the structure. However there are some features we wish to optimise. Among these
        features include, strength, stability, flexibility, material volume and, of course, beauty!

      <p class="paragraph">
        The Miura fold is special in that it has an auxetic nature (negative Poisson ratio). As
        a result, the folded Miura tessellation demonstrates increased deformability and
        structural stiffness, giving it great potential in the field of architecture.
