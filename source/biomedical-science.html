          <strong>Cell Origami:</strong> This was a technique developed by researchers from the University of Tokyo where living cells were placed on microplates. They stretched and adhered across multiple microplates and proceeded to self-folded to produce three-dimensional microstructures by using the cell traction force as the driving force to fold the microstructures. This self-folding technique did not involve any special material requirements and was achieved on a mass-production level with no damage caused to the cells.

          <strong>Drug Delivery:</strong> The role of drug carriers is to send the potent drug accurately with a suitable dose. The drug is first put into the carrier with calculated payload, and is sealed with the carrier by a DNA locker. Once the DNA locker detects the desired pathogenic bacteria, it will open and release the drug to the bacteria surface.
