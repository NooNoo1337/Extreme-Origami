      <p class="paragraph">
        Most of our exploration on the links between cosmology and origami have come from the findings of Mark Neyrinck,
        whose main study considers how galaxies and other structures form. He delves more specifically into how dense
        spots of invisible dark matter can suck in enough normal, gassy matter to create galaxies.

      <p class="paragraph">
        “Origami captures a lot of the essential physics of galaxy formation.”
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Origami is especially useful at representing the balance of the different structures found on the universe,
        including clusters of galaxies and dark matter. Neyrinck relates cosmological origami to paper origami through a
        mapping of a 3-D ‘dark matter sheet’ that may cross itself without resistance in 3-D, but may not cross itself
        in its 6-D velocity phase space. In doing so, he defines a crease-pattern as being analogous to what is known in
        cosmology as a ‘Lagrangian space’
