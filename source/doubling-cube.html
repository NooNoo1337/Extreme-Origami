        Doubling the Cube
      </h1>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Doubling the cube allows one to ‚Äì given the length of the first cube edge ‚Äì construct a second cube with double
        the volume of the first. The new cube has sides of length ‚àõ2 times the original length. Incidentally, this
        construction cannot be solved using Euclidean methods. It can however be solved using paper folding demonstrated
        below. For this demonstration, you need a square sheet of paper.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Step 1: <br>
        The first step includes starting with a square paper and folding it along one of its sides into three equal
        parts, as shown below. To make it easier, you can you can do both folds simultaneously and make sure that all
        three parts lie on top of one another perfectly.

      <p class="paragraph">
        Step 2: <br>
        This step is pretty tricky. You need to fold the paper in such a way that the bottom left corner is brought to
        the right edge. Now look at the two crease lines created in step 1. You also need the left end point of the
        bottom crease line to lie on the top crease line. Mark the point where the bottom left corner ended up.

      <p class="paragraph">
        As a result, this new position of the bottom left corner divides the right-hand side of the square into two
        parts, a and b, in a way that the ratio ùëéùëè=‚àõ2, which is what we were looking for.
