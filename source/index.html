      <p class="paragraph">
        The most successful and complete theories in physics are usually based on a small number of simple laws or rules
        which when obeyed, can create incredible levels of complexity. Origami, (“paper-folding”) is a traditional
        Japanese visual art form dating back to the 1600s, with the aim of forming intricate structures from a square
        piece of paper. Origami too follows only four simple rules from which an entirely self-consistent and
        non-Euclidean geometry arises. These rules are as follows:

      <ul class="list list--vertical">
        <li class="list__item">
          <svg class="list__marker" width="15" height="15">
            <use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#right-arrow"></use>
          </svg>
          Alternate angles around a vertex sum to a straight line.
        </li>
        <li class="list__item">
          <svg class="list__marker" width="15" height="15">
            <use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#right-arrow"></use>
          </svg>
          A crease pattern can be coloured using only two colours without having the same colour meeting.
        </li>
        <li class="list__item">
          <svg class="list__marker" width="15" height="15">
            <use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#right-arrow"></use>
          </svg>
          Mountain-valley counting: <span class="italic">M - V = ±2</span>.
        </li>
        <li class="list__item">
          <svg class="list__marker" width="15" height="15">
            <use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#right-arrow"></use>
          </svg>
          There are no self-intersections at overlaps of sheets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Contrary to general understanding, Origami is not a redundant practice. It has in fact evolved to become an
        important mathematical tool despite the strict constraints on folding.

        Origamist Yoshizawa, and later, physicist Robert Lang have propelled the development of this subject by
        exploring the pre-existing mathematical principles underpinning its aesthetic value. This form of mathematics is
        particularly interesting because it is able to elegantly solve mathematical problems that a compass and straight
        edge cannot.

      <p class="paragraph">
        This fact hints at the potential of Origami, and opens up an array of possibilities in the field of science by
        providing an alternative way of understanding old concepts, inspiring new ideas, and allowing for meaningful
        innovation.

        An example of an application to solve a real-world problem by folding is the Miura fold created by Koryo Miura.
        Miura studied Origami and developed a compact folding pattern for solar panels. In a similar way, we embark on
        an exploration of the uses of folding with different materials and techniques.

        We are 8 University College London (UCL) third year Physics undergraduates undertaking a PHAS0052 Physics Group
        Project module.
        In this 9-week-long project, we have worked as a team to research different applications of origami, test
        several shrinking materials for their folding capability and present our results in a form of a report, a
        presentation and a website you are currently on.
        This module let us all develop both as members of a team and individually.
